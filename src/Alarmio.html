                            About Alarmio
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            This was a project where I worked on with 2 other developers and 2 artists. A client
                            came by and told us what they were doing and that she needed idea's/products to use
                            for her company. As such, we made an app where you can see if you walk past a local store.
                            A local store in our terms means that what they produce locally produces. And that the
                            ingredients they use are local aswell. That would be better then products that were made 
                            with with ingredients that were imported abroad. And each time you were in a certain range
                            of a local store you'd get a message on your phone that says:"you walked past a local store"
                            and we made it that is was sort of a spam message, so you'd get aware that there are plenty
                            of local stores nearby.

                        <p>
                            I created the scene fade, so that it feels like an actual app opening up and loading in,
                            and then after a few seconds fading to the actual scene were you can walk around. Then 
                            a different developer created a joystick what makes you control the character and I 
                            optimalised the joystick so that wherever you touch on the screen the joystick appears.
                            Then I created a scene where I put everything together, and put the scripts on the right 
                            object and set it all so that it worked properly.

                            Conclusion
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            In the beginning was the comminucation very though because 3 out of the 5 people were
                            very shy, so they didn't talk that much, which ment that I and the other artist had to 
                            take the wheel and guide them towards victory. So we talked a lot to them but we got 
                            short answers back which was quite hard because you can't do much with that little 
                            information. But later on they opened up more and talked more, if I had to guess 
                            the reason was that they were feeling more comfortable being around with me and 
                            the others. Further more I learned how to make a scene fade which will come in handy
                            if I have to make 2d or 3d games in the future.
