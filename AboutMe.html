            <h1>More About Me</h1>
            <h2>What are your favorite hobbies?</h2>
            <p>My favorite thing to do right now is going to the gym and chase a look I cannot acquire.
                Aside from that I'd like to play a few games of League of Legends some now and then!
                I also enjoy programming websites and or games. But preferably websites..
            </p>
            <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
            <p>For now I have thought about it for a while but I haven't found a 'dream' job
                yet that I want to do when I finish school.
            </p>
            <h2>Where do you live?</h2>
            <p>I currently reside in a small town called Aalst.</p>
            <h2>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h2>
            <p>Because in movies I always liked the idea of 'hacking' things and this education 
                came the closest to what I had in mind.
