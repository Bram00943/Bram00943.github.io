                            About Gampie Western
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            I came up with an idea that had as inspiration the old arcade game "pong" but then
                            western style which cowboys shooting a bullet and deflecting them. Others came with
                            the idea to use ping pong bats to reflect them, I personally thought that was a little
                            bit odd, because realistically you can never deflect a bullet with a ball. But it's a 
                            game after all so I agreed, but to add a little bit of spice I came up the idea to add some
                            abilities/power-ups that should spawn random across the map and whenever the bullet
                            collides with the power-up you get the power-up. Further more the name Gampie is from a 
                            small company that develops games, it has two 'owners' and I am one of them, so I gave this
                            the name Gampie Western.

                            My contribution
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            Well I ofcourse contributed a lot because I created this on my own. Though I've gotten
                            a bit of help from others because when I first made it, I was quiet new to C#. So I had
                            to figure a lot of things out myself. But the art I've been sent was to be honest pretty
                            nice aswell, yet I wasn't able to put all of the art/animations in the game because there
                            were still a few bugs left to fix which were also sort of 'hard' to fix. For example the 
                            ability SixShooter was by far the hardest ability to code and also have to work it properly.
                            Since it was such a hard ability to code, with my knowledge, I had to ask a certain person
                            who is specialized in C# and Unity. And together we were able to make the ability just the
                            way it was supposed to work.

                            Conclusion
                        </summary>
                        <p>
                            Well, my conclusion is that I find it very entertaining to create games with or without people
                            obviously with other developers is more fun but doing it alone (for me) work better because
                            then you cannot ask for help for every problem you run into. So you have to come up with idea's
                            yourself to fix it, and by doing that you learn more then when you ask for help everytime. But I'm
                            still proud of the game and it works pretty much as I had in mind, it was very amazing to see the
                            game in the end because everything worked fine, without any errors.
