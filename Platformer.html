                    About Platformer
                </summary>
                <p>
                    This is a console based game, where I used a sort of dice based gameplay
                    where you get to 'roll' a dice and you fight a monster which is called 
                    Almighty Cooper, and if you roll a certain amount from 1-6 it's multiply's
                    by a amount. And from there on it damages Cooper and you can select the amount 
                    of player counting up to 4 and you can give them names and there are here and 
                    there cool futures.

                   Almight Cooper was a pretty hard console game. Because it was a lot of code (in my opinion)
                   for just a few little things. But I asked help pretty often, which was, when I look back
                   not the best option. Because I just instantly asked for help instead for looking for an 
                   solution. And a few things were pretty hard to understand because I was still quiet new 
                   to making a console game, especially with the dice aspect.

                    Conclusion
                </summary>
                <p>
                   I sort of liked making it but it's quiet sad that it's a console game instead of an
                   actual game powered by I don't know Unity, Unreal Engine. But I still think it looks
                   cool but I cannot do anything else with it except just playing it on my Visual Studio
                   and after a very short period of time it gets a little boring to be honest. But it worked
                   out pretty well because it's a game and it works.
